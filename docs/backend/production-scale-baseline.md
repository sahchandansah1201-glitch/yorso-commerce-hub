# YORSO Production Scale Baseline

Status: mandatory architecture gate
Batch: #36
Date: 2026-05-14

## Mandatory Target

YORSO production frontend, backend, persistence, queues, integrations and
agent-runtime decisions must be designed for stable operation with at least
10,000 concurrent web users.

This is a design and release gate. It does not claim that the current prototype
already passed a load test. A feature can stay prototype-only, but any feature
described as production-ready must include the capacity review below.

## Meaning Of 10,000 Concurrent Users

The target means 10,000 active users with overlapping sessions across catalog
search, supplier profile reads, account edits, access requests, RFQ flows,
notifications and agent-assisted workflows.

It does not mean 10,000 direct PostgreSQL connections. Browser users must go
through the web/API tier, PgBouncer, cache, queues and bounded data access.

Every production-facing feature must state:

- expected request rate and peak burst multiplier;
- expected read/write ratio;
- hot-path endpoints and cold-path endpoints;
- maximum synchronous request work;
- background job volume;
- timeout budget;
- graceful degradation behavior.

## Required Capacity Review

Every production-facing change must document these points before release
signoff:

| Area | Required answer |
|---|---|
| Read/write profile | Which operations are hot reads, hot writes, rare writes and background tasks? |
| Database strategy | Which indexes, pagination limits, bounded queries and transaction boundaries protect PostgreSQL? |
| Connection strategy | How do API workers avoid unbounded database connections through PgBouncer or equivalent pooling? |
| Cache strategy | Which reads are cacheable, what TTL is acceptable, and how is invalidation handled? |
| Queue/backpressure | Which work leaves the request path, how retries are bounded, and how idempotency is enforced? |
| Runtime scaling | Which processes are stateless, horizontally scalable and safe to restart? |
| Rate limits | Which user, IP, company or token limits prevent abuse and scraping? |
| Failure mode | What does the user see when API, search, queue, storage or analytics is degraded? |
| Observability | Which metrics, structured logs, traces and alerts prove the feature is healthy? |
| Load test | Which scenario validates the feature before production rollout? |

## Baseline Architecture Rules

For the self-hosted YORSO product:

- Frontend must not talk directly to PostgreSQL.
- Public pages and account UI must use typed API adapters.
- API workers must be stateless and horizontally scalable.
- PostgreSQL must sit behind PgBouncer or equivalent pooling.
- High-volume list/search endpoints must be indexed, paginated and bounded.
- Search-heavy marketplace discovery must not depend on unindexed table scans.
- Media and documents must live in object storage, not app container disks.
- Long-running imports, emails, notifications, reports and agent work must run
  in workers, not inside HTTP request handlers.
- Access-control-sensitive fields must be shaped by the API before reaching
  the frontend.
- Supabase may remain as prototype/reference tooling, not as production
  backend architecture.

## Current Repository Enforcement

The baseline is enforced by:

```bash
npm run check:production-scale-baseline
npm run ci:core
```

The guard verifies that backend architecture docs, validation docs, package
scripts, DB scaling migration and supplier-directory read path keep the
10,000-concurrent-user requirement visible and testable.

Batch #35 introduced the first concrete high-concurrency read-path work:

- `packages/db/migrations/0005_supplier_directory_search_scaling.sql`;
- `packages/db/migrations/0006_offer_catalog.sql`;
- trigram GIN indexes for supplier and offer search fields;
- verification-level index for supplier filters;
- frontend supplier directory and offer catalog API bridges with pagination.

Batch #36 promotes the target from a supplier-directory note to a project-level
release gate.

## Release Rule

If a change affects production frontend, backend, persistence, queues,
integrations or runtime behavior, release signoff must either:

1. reference a capacity review against this document; or
2. explicitly mark the change as prototype-only.

If neither is true, the change is not production-ready.
