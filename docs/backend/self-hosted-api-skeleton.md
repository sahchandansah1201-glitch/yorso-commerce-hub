# Self-Hosted API Skeleton

Status: first runnable backend process
Batch: #18
Date: 2026-05-13

`apps/api` is the first concrete backend service for the self-hosted YORSO
direction. It is intentionally small, but it is a real Node process that can be
compiled, started and wired into Docker Compose.

## Current Endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /health/live` | Confirms the API process is alive. |
| `GET /health/ready` | Confirms self-hosted dependencies are configured. |
| `GET /v1/account/company/schema` | Exposes the account/company DTO boundary used by frontend work. |

## Local Build

```bash
npm run api:build
npm run api:start
```

The API reads configuration from environment variables. Local defaults are
available for development, but production must provide real secrets and service
URLs.

## Docker Compose

The local compose baseline includes:

- `api`;
- `postgres`;
- `pgbouncer`;
- `redis`;
- `minio`.

The API service connects to PostgreSQL through PgBouncer, not directly to a
large pool of PostgreSQL connections.

## Supabase Boundary

The API skeleton does not import the Supabase client. In production mode it
rejects non-empty Supabase frontend env values. Supabase may remain only as a
prototype/schema-validation tool while the self-hosted backend matures.

## Validation

```bash
npm run check:self-hosted-api
npm run api:build
npm run test:api
npm run ci:core
```
