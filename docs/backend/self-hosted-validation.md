# Self-Hosted Backend Validation

Status: active guard
Batch: #17
Date: 2026-05-13

This repository is moving toward one deployable YORSO product:

- frontend;
- self-hosted YORSO API;
- PostgreSQL;
- PgBouncer;
- Redis;
- object storage;
- workers and operational tooling.

Supabase remains a temporary prototype and schema-validation tool. It must not
be treated as the future production backend.

## Required Commands

Run these commands before merging backend-direction changes:

```bash
npm run check:backend-policy
npm run check:supabase-boundary
npm run check:self-hosted-infra
npm run check:self-hosted-api
npm run check:self-hosted-db
npm run db:migrations:check
npm run api:build
npm run test:api
npm run test:db-contract
npm run test:db-migrations
npm run test:backend-contract
npm run ci:core
```

## What Each Check Protects

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `check:backend-policy` | Fails if backend docs describe Supabase as the production target. |
| `check:supabase-boundary` | Fails if new pages/components import the Supabase client directly. |
| `check:self-hosted-infra` | Fails if the local self-hosted runtime skeleton loses PostgreSQL, PgBouncer, Redis, MinIO or required env keys. |
| `check:self-hosted-api` | Fails if the standalone `apps/api` skeleton, Dockerfile, compose hook or Supabase production boundary is broken. |
| `check:self-hosted-db` | Fails if the self-hosted PostgreSQL baseline under `packages/db` loses required account/company tables or drifts toward Supabase-owned schema. |
| `db:migrations:check` | Builds the DB package and validates deterministic migration order, dependencies, safe relative paths and SQL checksums. |
| `api:build` | Compiles the self-hosted API service to `apps/api/dist`. |
| `test:api` | Runs API endpoint and config tests. |
| `test:db-contract` | Validates SQL baseline structure, enum boundaries and migration manifest. |
| `test:db-migrations` | Runs the DB package tests for the manifest planner, checksum generation and self-hosted SQL boundary. |
| `test:backend-contract` | Validates backend-facing DTOs and repository policy tests. |
| `ci:core` | Runs policy, infra, type, lint, build and contract checks together. |

## Static Docker Compose Validation

`check:self-hosted-infra` is intentionally static. It does not start Docker and
does not require Docker Desktop to be running.

It verifies:

- `api` is present as a self-hosted service;
- `infra/docker-compose.yml` declares PostgreSQL, PgBouncer, Redis and MinIO;
- PostgreSQL has a healthcheck;
- PgBouncer depends on healthy PostgreSQL and uses transaction pooling;
- Redis persists data locally;
- MinIO exposes API and console ports;
- `.env.example` contains all required self-hosted runtime variables;
- `.env.example` keeps Supabase frontend variables empty;
- `.env.example` does not contain service-role text, JWT-looking tokens or
  Supabase database URLs.

## DB Baseline Validation

`check:self-hosted-db` validates `packages/db` as the self-hosted PostgreSQL
source of truth. It checks:

- `_yorso_migrations`, the self-hosted schema registry;
- `yorso_users`, `yorso_companies`, `yorso_company_media`;
- enum boundaries matching account/company DTOs;
- indexes needed by account workspace reads;
- migration manifest ownership;
- absence of Supabase `auth.users` coupling in the self-hosted baseline.

`db:migrations:check` validates the TypeScript migration planner. It does not
connect to PostgreSQL yet. It verifies that every manifest entry points to a
safe SQL file, dependencies sort before dependents, SQL is checksumed, and the
plan is deterministic.

## API Skeleton Validation

`check:self-hosted-api` validates that `apps/api` is a real Node service, not a
documentation placeholder.

It verifies:

- `apps/api/src/index.ts` starts a standalone HTTP server;
- `/health/live` and `/health/ready` exist;
- `/v1/account/company/schema` exposes the account/company contract boundary;
- `apps/api/Dockerfile` builds and starts `apps/api/dist/index.js`;
- `infra/docker-compose.yml` wires the API service to PgBouncer, Redis and
  MinIO;
- Supabase frontend env values stay empty in the API compose service.

## Production Direction

The self-hosted stack should become the production path. Supabase scripts,
migrations and smoke tests may remain while they protect the prototype, but new
production-facing work should target YORSO-owned API contracts and PostgreSQL
deployment.

If a future change needs Supabase for a temporary prototype flow, document the
reason and keep it behind an adapter. Do not let page/component code import the
Supabase client as a production data gateway.
